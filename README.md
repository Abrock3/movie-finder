# Entertainment Finder

## Description

The Entertainment Finder web application allows an easy and convenient way for people to search for movies they might want to see, do research on them, and then be able to save them in a favorites list for future reference.  The main page also lists popular movies that are playing now.

The application allows users to search upcoming releases by genre, as well as the timeframe of the upcoming releases.  When users click on a choice, it takes them to a new page that gives more detail on the selection.

In addition, there is advanced search functionality that allows users to search on a variety of search criteria, including already released movies.

## Future

This is the first iteration of the application, or Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Although the application is called, "Entertainment Finder," we have elected to start with Movies.   Therefore, you will see Movie Finder in the nav bar.  The plan is to add future entertainment choices such as concerts, sporting events, etc.

In addition, the following tasks are on our roadmap:

- Add to calendar option to make it easy to schedule
- Ability to go to next page of search results
- Ability to search by movie title
- Improved user interface and visual design
